# Bayesian-optimization
Used three databases found on UCI, all of which are classified. 
1. The neural network made by cars optimizes the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, and the number of hidden layer nodes; 
2. The svm made by transfusion optimizes c, g and c and g respectively; 
3. The SVM and neural network made by iris, the SVM optimizes c and g, the neural network Optimize the learning rate and the number of hidden layers.
